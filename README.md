# New Definition for high frequency correlated noise in the Global Mean Sea Level uncertainty budget

The current GMSL uncertainty budget is described in Guerou et al 2023 () and presented in the following figure.

This uncertainty budget leads to uncertainties associated to the GMSL parameters' of $0.3 mm.yr^{-1}$ for the trend and $0.05 mm.yr^{-2}$ for the acceleration over the whole altimetry era (approximately 30 years).
Scientific objectives are to obtain an uncertainty associated with the trend of the GMSL of $0.1 mm.yr^{-1}$ over a 10 years period (Meyssignac et al 2023). To do so, it is mandatory to better understand the measurement and associated errors.

In this study, we focus on the two first line of the GMSL uncertainty budget: High Frequency correlated noise (2-months and 1-year). The following figure (also from Guerou et al 2023) describes the relative contribution of all sources of uncertainty to the total uncertainty associated with the trend over 10 years periods.

A better characterization of those high frequency correlated noise (red and orange curves) could lead to a decrease of their contribution and thus decrease the total uncertainty to get closer to the objective fixed by the climate scientists community.
